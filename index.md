The System Deployment Provenance Ontology (SDPO) is an extension of the [PROV-O ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) and the [Semantic Sensor Network Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) (SSN) created to describe the activities, entities, and agents that have influenced the deployment of SSN Systems.  [SSN Systems]( https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SSNSystem) represent pieces of infrastructure that can be composed of subsystems, such as [Sensors]( https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSASensor), [Actuators]( https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAActuator), and [Samplers](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSASampler) in a variety of domains, including the Internet of Things.  

SSN describes System [deployments]( https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SSNDeployment) as the “deployment of one or more Systems for a particular purpose” with refernces to the deployed system and [Platforms](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAPlatform) on which Systems are deployed. SDPO extends the information that can be provided about deployments by providing a vocabulary to document the activities that have occurred before and during a deployment.  Here SDPO adopts the PROV-O approach to describe the provenance of a deployment as a record of the activities with associated agents (people, software, etc.) and entities (things used and generated by activities) that have influenced a deployment in some way.  This is achieved by building on the [SOSA PROV Alignment Model]( https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#PROV_Alignment) (the [SOSA ontology](h ttp://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/) provides the core concepts of SSN) and a previous [SSN-PROV-O alignment]( ceur-ws.org/Vol-1401/paper-05.pdf).

In SDPO, SSN Deployments are viewed as PROV-O Activities (which is consistent with the previous SSN-PROV-O alignment).  SDPO defines the [Deployment Related Activity]( https://trustlens.github.io/sdpo/index-en.html#DeploymentRelatedActivity) class, a sub-class of PROV-O Activity, to describe the activities that have occurred at some time prior to, during, or following the deployment of one of more SSN Systems.  SDPO defines several sub-classes of Deployment Related Activity allowing users to describe some of the different types of activities that have occurred.  These includes: installation, calibration, maintenance, and removal of the system; inspections of the area (site) surrounding where a system has been deployed; design of the deployment; and review, validation, quality control, and quality assurance activities of the data generated by a system.  

Along with the ontology, a number of [PROV-Templates]( https://provenance.ecs.soton.ac.uk/prov-template/) are also [available on the github repo]( https://github.com/TrustLens/sdpo/tree/master/prov-templates/templates), which provide suggested provenance patterns for some of the deployment related activities.  In Luc Moreau’s words, PROV-Templates “describing the shape of provenance graphs to be generated” – for more information about PROV-Templates and how to use them with the [ProvToolbox]( http://lucmoreau.github.io/ProvToolbox/) , please see Luc’s two blog posts ([part one](https://lucmoreau.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/provtoolbox-tutorial-4-templates-for-provenance-part-1/), [part two](https://lucmoreau.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/provtoolbox-tutorial-4-templates-for-provenance-part-2/)).
